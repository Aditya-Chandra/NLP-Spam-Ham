This is a project of NLP where I have build a model to detect Spam/Ham and finally deployed it on Heroku (PaaS) platform after building web app using Flask web framework.

In the web app we need to provide input as text message and then need to press PREDICT button after which it will show output as SPAM or HAM based on prediction.

The link of the web app is given below.

I will be making a video on the process involved and will post it on my Youtube channel by the name Neuraldata (sole purpose of this channel is to provide free education and spread awareness among data science community).
